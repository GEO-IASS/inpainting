Inpainting
==========

A MATLAB implementation of the revolutionary Kulkarni and Rajagopalan algorithm[1] for inpainting using tensor voting.

The tensor voting framework was taken from [here](http://www.mathworks.in/matlabcentral/fileexchange/21051-tensor-voting-framework) and NDTensorVoting.exe was taken from [here](iris.usc.edu/Projects/tensorvt/tensorvt.html).
